## 💡 Pro Tips

### Maximize Daily XP
```
Login Bonus:     10-40 XP (automatic)
5 Daily Missions: 75-150 XP (one click each)
Custom Actions:  Variable (as needed)
---
Total Daily:     85-190+ XP minimum
```

### Streak Management
- Log in every day (even if just to claim bonus)
- Complete at least 1 mission daily
- Login streak increases bonus XP

### Efficient Leveling
1. **Morning routine:** Claim login bonus + check missions
2. **Throughout day:** Complete missions as you do activities
3. **Evening:** Add any custom XP for unlisted activities
4. **Before bed:** Check if all missions done

### Rank Optimization
